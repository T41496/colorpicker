# ColorPicker

I made this project using Svelte.

## How to run and build

In the project directory, you should run:

### `npm install`

It will download all necessary packages.

### `npm run preview`

Run this command to run the project.
And then visit localhost:4173 on your web browser such as Google Chrome.
### `npm run build`

Run this command to build the project.
It will make the build version to dist directory.
